# datapasta 3.2.0
* Compatibility with {rstudioapi} emulation in VSCode
* Fixed Datetime handling for data piped to `dpasta`

# datapasta 3.1.0 'Leave to Simmer'
* Exported `_format` functions
* Adds `dt_paste` function for pasting as `data.table` (Thanks @jonocarroll, #72, closes #70)
* Row names are kept in data.frames and data.tables (Thanks @sowla)
* Column names that are invalid are now handled with backticks (Thanks @sharlagelfand)
* Fixes issue with commas inside character vectors getting wrapped on
* data.frame (and data.table) print is much prettier and robust with all args and cols aligned on '='
* zero row tibbles are supported with a fall-back to a tibble::tibble() call
* all _construct functions now return input visibly
* Fallback behaviour added to allow usage with remote R sessions like RStudio Server/Cloud, or ssh command line. See 'datapasta in the cloud' vignette. (Thanks @gadenbuie, @jonthegeek)

# datapasta 3.0.0 'Colander Helmet'

* When pasting from clipboard it now attempts to guess if there is no header row, in the case where the clipboard is all data. If you're lucky it will create a default header for you when pasting (V1, V2, V3 etc.).
* `dpasta()` will now handle tribbles with R classes that cannot be represented in tribble form. It falls back to their character representation. This works well for things like dates.
* New addin: 'Fiddle Selection'. This is a kind of magic wand that can be waved over RStudio editor selections to: Reflow messy tribble and data.frame definitions, create `c()` expressions from raw data, and pivot `c()` exprs between vertical and horizontal format.
* New addin: 'Toggle Vector Quotes'. Given a horizontal or vertical `c()` expr, it will toggle all elements between quoted and bare format.
* Complies with new CRAN policy on clipboard use. You cannot write to the clipboard in non-interactive sessions with `dmdclip()` - Why would you?. Tests containing clipboard use are skipped on CI and CRAN.

# datapasta 2.0.1

* Added a trailing newline after all pastes, this works much nicer for console output.
* Fixed handling of backslashes. Relying on built-in function deparse() for escaping chars that need it.

# datapasta 2.0.0 'Fusilli Jerry'

* Added the ability to parse objects from R and output as neatly formatted tibbles, dataframes and vectors with `dpasta`. The clipboard is not involved.
* Added the ability to send these same types of objects to the clipboard formatted for markdown output with `dmdclip`.
* Package can now operate in a close to fully featured way in editors other than RStudio. Output goes to console rather than cursor.
* Added hooks for output customisation with `_construct()` functions that return the formatted output as an R character vector.
* The decimal mark can be set for numeric data with `dp_set_decimal_mark`.
* User can now paste natural looking comma separated lists as vectors, with automatic comma-splitting and whitespace trimming.  

# datapasta 1.1.0 'CopyPesto'

* Added `df_paste()` which pastes a table from the clipboard using a nicely formatted call to `data.frame()` rather than `tribble()`
* Better handling for empty lines that get accidentally copied onto clipboard with table. Gracefully ignored.

# datapasta 1.0.0

* Added new addin 'Paste as vector (vertical)' to provide nicer formatting for long lists.
* All addins now guess data types and format correctly in the source editor.
* Empty rows in tables and empty cells in lists are formatted as NA's when pasting instead of being ignored.
* Added vignette, automated tests etc in prep for CRAN submission.

# datapasta 0.2

* Added graceful error handling on failed parse of text on clipboard to table.
* `tribble_paste()` and `vector_paste()` now pastes NA's as unquoted, so R will parse as proper NA.
* `tribble_paste()` can parse an paste table text copied from raw delimited file e.g. csv, tsv, pipe delimited, semi-colon delimited.
* `vector_paste()` uses a space between elements.

# datapasta 0.1.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Fixed the handling of NAs in tab delimited files which resulted in phantom NA columns sometimes appearing with `tribble_paste()`
